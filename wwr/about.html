      <h2>History</h2>
      <div class="history-content">
        <p>
          Rafting Adventure Company was founded in 2008 by a group of passionate river guides who shared a common dream: 
          to make the thrill of whitewater rafting accessible to everyone. 
          What started as a small outfit operating a single raft on the lower rapids of the Clear Creek Canyon
           has since grown into one of the region’s most respected and trusted adventure companies. Over the years, we’ve expanded our operations from one river to five,
            offering trips on some of the most scenic and challenging waterways in the country. 
            Our team has grown too—from just three original guides to over 40 experienced and certified outdoor professionals,
             all committed to safety, adventure, and unforgettable experiences. In 2012, we introduced our Family Floats and Youth Expedition Programs, 
             helping to make rafting a multigenerational experience that connects people of all ages with the natural world. 
             By 2016, we had partnered with local conservation groups to promote environmental stewardship and river preservation,
              a cause that remains central to our mission today. Through every turn and rapid, Rafting Adventure Company has stayed true to its roots:
               a deep respect for nature, a love for adventure, and a dedication to delivering extraordinary outdoor experiences.
                Today, we continue to lead rafting trips for thrill-seekers, families, and 
                corporate groups alike—turning first-time paddlers into lifelong adventurers.

          <h3>The Spirit of Adventure</h3>
          <p>
            At Rafting Adventure Company, adventure isn’t just something we offer — it’s the heartbeat of everything we do. 
            From the moment you step into your raft and feel the tug of the river’s current,
            you’ll understand why our guests come back year after year. Our journeys are more than just rides through rapids,
            they are immersive experiences in the wild, where adrenaline meets awe and courage meets connection. Each trip begins with the unknown, 
            the roar of rushing water, the crisp spray of the river, and the breathtaking beauty of canyons, cliffs, and forests surrounding you. 
            As you paddle through swirling rapids, glide across calm stretches, and laugh with your crew, you’re not just navigating a river, 
            you’re discovering something deeper about yourself. Whether you're conquering Class IV rapids with a group of thrill-seekers,
            floating peacefully with family on a scenic route, or tackling your fear of the unknown for the first time, 
            every journey we guide is designed to inspire, challenge, and transform. Our expert guides are more than safety instructors, 
            they are storytellers, nature lovers, and fellow adventurers, passionate about sharing their love for the river and the outdoors. 
            With their support, you'll build teamwork, gain confidence, and make memories that will last a lifetime.
